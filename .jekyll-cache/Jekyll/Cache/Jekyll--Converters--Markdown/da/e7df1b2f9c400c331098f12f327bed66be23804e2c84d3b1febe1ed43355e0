<h2 id="what-is-a-report">What is a Report</h2>

<p>A report, also known as a technical report, is typically issued by a research 
institution which evaluates and affirms the work. This evaluation is an 
internal process and accordingly, reports are not ‘peer reviewed’ literature.</p>

<p>Technical reports are usually produced to report on a specific research need. 
They can serve as a report of accountability to the organization funding the 
research. They provides access to the information before it is published 
elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the ARFC Github organization, there are several template repositories designed to aid the 
writing/creating process by giving you a starting place for formatting. To use the 
<a href="https://github.com/arfc/report-template">report template</a>, select the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Use this Template</code> 
option next to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Code</code>.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Use this Template</code> will generate a repository on your GitHub account with copies of all the 
files in the original, including the Readme file. The Readme will serve as your point of 
reference for how to initialize the documents and some common errors that occur upon initial 
startup. Keep in mind that this template has a 
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.ast">CC-BY-4.0 License</a>. This license is 
the standard for written works and reports; however, there are cases where the use of material 
containing viral or copyleft licenses (such as GPL) can affect the type of license you can 
use in your report.</p>
